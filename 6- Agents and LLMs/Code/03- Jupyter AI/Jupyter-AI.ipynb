       "# Backtracking with Python3: A Tutorial\n",
       "\n",
       "Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, particularly constraint satisfaction problems. It incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate (\"backtracks\") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly lead to a valid solution.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Core Concepts\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Recursive:** Backtracking is inherently recursive.  We explore a solution space by making choices and then recursively calling the function to explore the consequences of those choices.\n",
       "* **Constraints:**  Problems solved with backtracking have constraints that define valid solutions.  These constraints are used to prune the search space and avoid exploring paths that are guaranteed to be invalid.\n",
       "* **State Space:** The set of all possible configurations or choices represents the state space. Backtracking systematically explores this space.\n",
       "* **Choice, Constraint, and Goal:**\n",
       "    * **Choice:**  At each step, you choose an option.\n",
       "    * **Constraint:** You check if the choice is valid given the current state.\n",
       "    * **Goal:**  You check if the choice leads to a solution.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Example: N-Queens Problem\n",
       "\n",
       "The N-Queens problem is a classic example of a problem solved with backtracking. The goal is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other (i.e., no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).\n",

       "\n",
       "### Explanation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **`solve_nqueens(n)`:** This function initializes the `solutions` list and the `board` list (representing the board).  It then calls the `backtrack` function to start the search.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **`is_safe(row, col)`:** This function checks if placing a queen at `(row, col)` is safe, considering queens already placed in previous rows.  It checks for conflicts in the same column and on diagonals.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **`backtrack(row)`:**  This is the recursive function that implements the backtracking logic:\n",
       "   - **Base Case:**  If `row == n`, it means we've successfully placed queens in all rows, so we found a solution.  We append a copy of the `board` to the `solutions` list.\n",
       "   - **Recursive Step:**  For each column `col` in the current row `row`:\n",
       "     - If `is_safe(row, col)` returns `True`, we place a queen at `(row, col)` by setting `board[row] = col`.\n",
       "     - We recursively call `backtrack(row + 1)` to try placing queens in the next row.\n",
       "     - **Backtracking Step:** If the recursive call doesn't lead to a solution, we implicitly backtrack by continuing the loop and trying the next column.  This effectively removes the queen from the current position and explores other possibilities.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **`print_board(board)`:**  Helper function to visualize the solutions.\n",
       "\n",
       "### How Backtracking Works in N-Queens\n",
       "\n",
       "The algorithm explores the search space by trying to place queens one row at a time.  If a placement leads to a conflict (i.e., `is_safe` returns `False`), the algorithm *backtracks* by removing the queen and trying a different column.  This continues until a valid solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.\n",
       "\n",
       "## General Backtracking Template\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def backtrack(candidate, state, solutions):\n",
       "    \"\"\"\n",
       "    Generic backtracking function.\n",
       "\n",
       "    Args:\n",
       "        candidate:  The current candidate solution being built.\n",
       "        state:  The current state of the problem.\n",
       "        solutions:  A list to store valid solutions.\n",
       "    \"\"\"\n",
       "    if is_solution(candidate, state):\n",
       "        solutions.append(candidate)\n",
       "        return\n",
       "\n",
       "    for choice in get_choices(candidate, state):\n",
       "        if is_valid(candidate, choice, state):\n",
       "            new_candidate = make_choice(candidate, choice)\n",
       "            new_state = update_state(state, choice)\n",
       "            backtrack(new_candidate, new_state, solutions)\n",
       "            # Backtrack:  Undo the choice (optional, depends on the problem)\n",
       "            # new_candidate = remove_choice(new_candidate, choice)\n",
       "            # new_state = revert_state(new_state, choice)\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "## Tips for Backtracking\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Pruning:** The most important aspect of backtracking is effective pruning.  Identify constraints early and use them to avoid exploring branches of the search space that cannot lead to valid solutions.\n",
       "* **Order of Choices:** The order in which you explore choices can significantly affect performance.  Try to explore promising choices first.\n",
       "* **State Representation:** Choose a state representation that makes it easy to check constraints and update the state.\n",
       "* **Copying State:** Be careful when appending solutions to a list.  You need to append a *copy* of the candidate solution, not the candidate itself, to avoid modifying previously found solutions.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Backtracking is a powerful technique for solving a wide range of problems, including puzzles, optimization problems, and constraint satisfaction problems. Understanding the core concepts and applying effective pruning strategies are key to writing efficient backtracking algorithms.\n"
